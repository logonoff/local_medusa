# local_medusa
Very basic medusa example  

Note that the code is very hacky, please improve it before using yourself!

The prefix of the bot must be set to "." as defined by `NeighbourhoodSnek.cs`

Instructions on how to build and install medusae can be found [here](https://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medusa/creating-a-medusa#build-it)
